# Requirements for Transcode Videos Script v0.5.0
# 
# This script uses only Python standard library modules - no pip packages required!
# This design keeps the project lightweight and reduces dependency management complexity.
#
# External dependencies (must be installed separately):
# 
# 1. HandBrakeCLI: Command-line video transcoding tool
#    Download from: https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php
#    Used for: Video transcoding with presets and subtitle support
#
# 2. FFprobe (part of FFmpeg): Video analysis tool
#    Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
#    Used for: Video resolution detection, codec analysis, bitrate analysis
#    Note: Required for pre-transcode analysis features (resolution checking,
#          codec detection, and predicting likely file size increases)
#
# Installation notes:
# - Both HandBrakeCLI and ffprobe must be available in your system PATH
# - On Windows: Add installation directories to PATH environment variable
# - On macOS: Install via Homebrew: brew install handbrake ffmpeg
# - On Linux: Install via package manager: apt install handbrake-cli ffmpeg
#
# Python version: 3.6+ (tested on 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
# 
# Standard library modules used:
# - os                    (file system operations)
# - subprocess            (external process execution)
# - shutil               (file operations)
# - tempfile             (temporary file handling)
# - datetime             (timestamp generation)
# - csv                  (logging functionality)
# - threading            (multi-threading support)
# - concurrent.futures   (thread pool execution)
# - queue                (thread communication)
# - time                 (timing operations)
# - sys                  (system interface)
# - signal               (signal handling for Ctrl+C)
# - platform             (platform detection)
# - json                 (JSON parsing for ffprobe output)
#
# Platform-specific modules (optional, for enhanced functionality):
# - ctypes               (Windows API for process suspension/resume, console handlers)
# - msvcrt               (Windows console I/O helpers)
# - select               (Unix I/O multiplexing)
# - tty                  (Unix terminal control)
# - termios              (Unix terminal interface)

# v0.5.0 highlights (no extra pip deps):
# - Reliable Ctrl+C pause menu on Windows via SetConsoleCtrlHandler
# - HandBrakeCLI launched in its own process group to avoid accidental kill
# - Optional Windows process suspension of HandBrake during pause
# - Improved logging: interrupted vs failed for clean retries

# No pip packages required - all dependencies are part of Python standard library!
